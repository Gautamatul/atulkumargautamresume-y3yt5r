	Professional Software Engineer with over <b>{{totalYears}}<span *ngIf="totalMonths !== 0">.{{totalMonths}}</span> years</b> of experience working on enterprise web applications and web services.
  I enjoy being challenged where I have to solve problems and I like working on projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development skills is more like gaining perfection on technological aspects which are the foundation of Software Development.
  Always curious about doing research on better solution and the application at architect level.
